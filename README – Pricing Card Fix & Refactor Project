# README – Pricing Card Fix & Refactor Project

## Project Overview

This project involved taking a broken pricing card component (HTML and CSS), fixing its layout and structural issues, and then refactoring it into a reusable component using JavaScript.
All debugging and refactoring were done inside Cursor using an AI-assisted workflow.

---

## What I Did

### 1. Imported the broken code into Cursor

The original snippet contained several issues, including:

* Misspelled CSS properties (for example, `box-shdow`)
* Incorrect or unclosed HTML tags
* Layout problems and inconsistent spacing
* A button that wasn’t fully interactive
* No modularity or reusable logic

Cursor helped identify these problems and suggested corrections.

---

### 2. Fixed all structural and layout bugs

Using the prompt I wrote, Cursor corrected:

* All CSS typos
* Invalid HTML structure
* The box shadow property
* Button styling and hover states
* Spacing, alignment, and general layout issues
* Basic responsiveness for different screen sizes

The updated version is now functional, visually clean, and loads properly.

---

### 3. Refactored the component for reuse

I asked Cursor to convert the static layout into a reusable component using a function:

```js
Card({ title, price, features })
```

Cursor generated:

* `index.html` to load and display the card
* `style.css` to handle all styling
* `card.js` to define the reusable card component

By changing the function parameters, the same component can now render different pricing plans.

---

### 4. Structured the project files

The project files were organized as follows:

```
/pricing-card-component
│── index.html
│── style.css
│── card.js
│── README.md
│── before.html
│── after.html
```

---

### 5. Tested the final component

I opened `index.html` in the browser and verified that:

* The layout renders correctly
* Styles load normally
* The button behaves as expected
* The features list is generated dynamically
* The card adjusts well on smaller screens

## AI Prompt Used in Cursor

Below is the exact prompt used to fix and refactor the snippet:

```
I am providing you with a broken pricing card HTML/CSS snippet.

Your tasks:
1. Fix all bugs (HTML structure, CSS typos, responsiveness).
2. Make it clean, semantic, and accessible.
3. Refactor it into a reusable component:
   Card({ title, price, features })
4. Output the fixed version, the refactored component, and a short explanation.
```

---

## Final Output

The project deliverables included:

* The original broken snippet (before.html)
* The corrected version (after.html)
* The reusable component (index.html, style.css, card.js)
* This README

---

## Result

The broken pricing card was successfully converted into a clean, fully working, responsive, and reusable UI component.
